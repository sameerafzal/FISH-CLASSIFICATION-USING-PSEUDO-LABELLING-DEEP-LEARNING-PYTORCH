# FISH-CLASSIFICATION-USING-PSEUDO-LABELLING-DEEP-LEARNING-PYTORCH

The task of classifying different species of fish using deep learning models presents several significant challenges. The primary objective of this challenge is to design and validate a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying fish species. The dataset provided consists of a small labeled training dataset of annotated images, a test dataset, and an auxiliary dataset of unannotated images. The small size of the labeled training dataset and the large volume of unlabeled data introduce unique difficulties and opportunities in model training and validation.
One of the main challenges is the limited size of the labeled training dataset. With only 150 annotated images, training a deep learning model from scratch is impractical due to the high risk of overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data. Additionally, the dataset contains 15 different species, each exhibiting significant inter-species variation and intra-species similarity, making the classification task even more complex.
To address these challenges, our proposed solution leverages a combination of transfer learning and semi-supervised learning techniques, specifically pseudo-labeling, to effectively utilize both the small labeled dataset and the large auxiliary dataset of unannotated images. By combining the strengths of pre-trained models with the augmentation benefits of semi-supervised learning, our approach enhances the modelâ€™s performance and ensures it generalizes well to new data. The key innovations lie in the strategic integration of pre-trained networks, confidence-based pseudo-labeling, and iterative retraining, providing a robust solution for the fish species classification task.
